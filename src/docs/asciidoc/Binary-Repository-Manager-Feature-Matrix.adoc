|By default blocks bad poms in runtime instead of polluting your repository and reporting after the fact (policy is configurable via UI)
|&#10004; + 
RSS Feeds and UI viewer for bad checksums and artifacts with bad poms. 
Bad poms are allowed through by default because many times Maven can still use them. We don't believe that simply inserting a repo manager should cause things to suddenly fail from Central. The repo man should for the most part be transparent by default

Using Ant-like simple to understand patterns + OOTB templates for common include/excludes. Supports inclusion and exclusion so no need to used negative patterns for protecting sources etc
|&#10004; + 
Using the regex to control the paths, it is possible to secure separately any artifacts you want. Comes configured with targets to specify sources, which would allow you for example to have jars be downloaded anonymously but not the sources, even though they are sitting in the same repository

|Out of the box LDAP support
|*?* + 
partially for authz
|&#10004; + 
Configurable via the web UI
|&#10004; + 
Including role mappings, Active Directory support and more

|Able to use LDAP groups (authorization from ldap)
|*?* 
|&#10004; + 
Including highly optimized caching and comprehensive UI integration in Pro
|&#10004; + 
(Open Sourced in 1.5+)

|Supports multiple realms in order (ie LDAP then fallback to internal)
|*?* 
|&#10004; + 
With control of whether to fallback to internal users or not. +
Including Kerberos and native NTLM in Pro
|&#10004; + 
ordered control of cascading though configured realms -- as many as you have installed

|&#10004; +
Security integration with Atlassian Crowd provided by Pro plugin

|SAML integration	
|&#10008; 
|&#10004; + 
SSO with any SAML IdP (Identity Provider). Artifactory can act as a SAML Service Provider
|&#10008;

|Secured settings.xml passwords
|&#10008; + 
functionality already available in Maven 2.1.0
|&#10004; + 
Centrally-controlled encrypted password policy so admins do not have to rely on clients security policy. Auto-generated encrypted passwords can be used in your settings.xml or with non Maven REST clients, such as Ivy, Gradle etc. +
Overcomes Maven drawbacks (including Maven 2.1+) - Maven decrypts the password to clear-text on the client, and keeps a clear-text master password on the filesystem
|&#10004; + 
Via the http://blog.sonatype.com/2012/08/securing-repository-credentials-with-nexus-pro-user-tokens[User Token] feature. The token is a random api key and is not reversible to your corporate password, even by Nexus administrators. This was co-developed with a stock market that needed higher security than was is available elsewhere

|Configuration files protection

|CI-Build Promotion
|&#10008; 
|&#10004; + 
Can promote CI builds to target repositories with selective scopes (e.g. promote all artifacts and all compile-time dependencies). Also via REST (Pro)
|&#10008;

|Optimized Deployment
|&#10008; 
|&#10004; + 
Deploys all artifacts in one go only at the end of a successful build (Maven deploys partial modules for a broken multi-module build)
|&#10004; + 
Custom deploy plugin works with Staging to stage locally and deploy/promote at the end of the build
